## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and play a crucial role in arranging elements in a specific order. The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer provides an interactive way to see how these algorithms function step-by-step, offering insights into their efficiency and behavior for different data sets.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms.
- Choose from a variety of sorting algorithms to observe.
- Adjustable speed control to slow down or speed up the visualization.
- Random data generation for easy testing and experimentation.
- User-friendly interface for an intuitive experience.

## Getting Started

To use the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

That's it! Now you can explore and interact with the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer currently supports the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Usage

1. Upon opening the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer, you will be presented with a graphical interface displaying a random set of data that requires sorting.

2. Choose a sorting algorithm from the available options using the dropdown menu.

3. Adjust the speed control slider to set the visualization speed according to your preference.

4. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.

5. Observe the algorithm in action as it sorts the data. The visualizer will highlight the elements being compared and swapped, making it easier to comprehend the sorting process.

6. You can reset the data at any time by clicking the "Generate New Data" button.

7. Have fun exploring different algorithms and comparing their performance on various data sets!
